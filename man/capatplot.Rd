\title{Plots cause of death pattern for a region over time}
\usage{
capatplot(ag, ctry, cas, aws = NA, alabs = agelabs, ca2 = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{ctry}{WHO region code (use "all" for all regions).}

\item{cas}{Vector of cause codes.}

\item{aws}{Data frame with age groups for aggregation.
The standard frame "aw" is suited for causes related to aging, with higher age groups fine-grained.
The frame "aw_y" is suited for causes commong among young adults, like HIV and external causes.}

\item{alabs}{Vector with labels of the same length as the age groups.}

\item{ca2}{Denominator cause (use "pop" for population to get death rates).}
